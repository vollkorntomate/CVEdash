# CVEdash Frontend App

The frontend is built with SvelteKit.

It is configured as a statically generated site, so there will be no server-side rendering involved.

## Build and run

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

To run the app locally:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Use `npm run format` to format the code using `prettier`.
